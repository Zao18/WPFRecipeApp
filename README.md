FeedBack Section ðŸ““

For the feedback given for part 2 I have tried to correct as much of it as possible but due to much troubleshootign and time restrictions I wasnt able to fix and implement them into my WPF application.

The first one I remember is that I hadnt used delegates correctly, I had tried to implement it correctly but due it it being complicated for me i decided to just do it another way and focas on the functionality of my WPF application.

The second one I remember if that the restart button wasnt a good button to be used for restarting the application to add a new recipe do to fix this I have renamed the button to make it do the user knows that the button is for entering a new recipe.
